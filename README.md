# BDNF opiumAddiction

The genotype file of the Drug addicted subjects and controls. Data file are in plink format (https://zzz.bwh.harvard.edu/plink/data.shtml).

Opioid use disorder or addiction has been widely investigated and is genetic in nature. The common variants present in the population might be modulating the risk by affecting the expression level of brain specific isoforms. In the current study, common variants in the promoter region of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and Dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) were genotyped in the individuals from the highly prevalent opium addiction geographical region. The control samples were also selected from the same region that might be having similar exposure as addicts. The short isoform of the BDNF highly express in the brain and two mutations (rs7944119:G>T and rs13306221:C>T) in the promoter were significantly associated with the addiction. Both minor allele rs7944119-T and rs13306221-T increases the risk of the addiction. Of these rs7944119 was in linkage disequilibrium with rs13306221 and due to hitchhiking showed association, as evident in the regression analysis. The rs13306221-T was associated with less expression level of the short isoform in the Cerebellar cortex. It suggests that rs13306221-T increases risk of addiction by decreasing the expression level of the brain-specific short isoform of BDNF. Since, less expression level is associated with mutation present in the addicted subjects, it also suggest that changes in the expression of the BDNF is not the effect of the addiction, but cause of the disease. Although, it should be explored further in more detail.
